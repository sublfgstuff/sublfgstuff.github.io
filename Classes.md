		<h3>Summer 2023 </h3>
		<p>Currently I am working under Dr. Santanu Mondal at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) Bangalore. Right now I am studying the high energy gamma ray emission of various galaxies using Fermi LAT data. An extremely engaging project to work on, and I am learning a lot of new things.</p>

		<h3>Summer 2022</h3>
		<p>I took up a reading project under Dr. Prasenjit Das at IISER Mohali, trying to simulate phase transitions in spin lattice systems using Monte Carlo techniques. I was primarily trying to replicate the results of the paper by Steinberg et al. This was my first ever project, and again I gained a very valuable exposure to the world of academia, thanks to Dr. Das.</p>
